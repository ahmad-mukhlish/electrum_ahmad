Flutter mobile application.

## Tech Stack

- Flutter 3.x
- Dart SDK ^3.9.2
- State management: Riverpod (2 skills available)
- Routing: go_router
- Primary datasource: Firebase Auth and Firestore

## Why Riverpod

- Pairs cleanly with `go_router`; avoids routing conflicts seen with GetX.
- Less boilerplate and ceremony than Bloc while staying explicit and testable.
- Keeps dependency injection light and composable as features grow.

## Why Firebase Auth and Firestore

- Chosen to focus on app architecture, UX, and state management without owning backend buildout.
- Data access is funneled through the data layer so another backend can be swapped later without touching other layers.

## AI-assisted workflow and per-feature docs

- Each feature includes a `docs/` folder with:
    - `docs/brief.md` → manual brief containing:
        - Context
        - Scope
        - Requirements
        - Clues
        - Keep in mind
    - `docs/plan.md` → AI-assisted implementation plan
      (generated with Claude / other tools and then curated).
- Current auth tasks documented under `features/auth/docs/`:
    - `slicing-ui/brief.md` and `slicing-ui/plan-ai.md`
    - `integrate-be/brief.md` and `integrate-be/plan-ai.md`
- Repeat this pattern for every big task: add a subfolder under the feature’s `docs/` with `brief.md` and `plan-ai.md` before implementation.

## Commands

```bash
flutter run          # Run app
flutter test         # Run tests
flutter analyze      # Lint check
flutter build apk    # Build Android
flutter build ios    # Build iOS
```

## Conventions

- Skills stored in `.claude/skills`; use both available skills when applicable
- Firebase Auth + Firestore are used as the primary backend; keep access funneled through the data layer so other backends can be swapped in later if needed.
- AI-assisted development implementation: every big task keeps `docs/<task>/brief.md` and `docs/<task>/plan-ai.md` so humans and AI share intent, maintain context across sessions, and minimize token usage.
