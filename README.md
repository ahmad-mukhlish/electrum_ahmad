Flutter mobile application targeting mobile and web, with platform-specific widgets split for clarity.

## Tech Stack

- Flutter 3.x
- Dart SDK ^3.9.2
- State management: Riverpod
- Primary datasource : Firebase Auth and Firestore

## Why Riverpod?

- Modern, compile-safe state management that pairs cleanly with `go_router`; GetX brings its own router, which conflicts with that approach.
- Less boilerplate and ceremony than Bloc while staying testable and explicit.
- Keeps dependency injection light and composable as features grow.

## Why Firebase Auth and Firestore?

This is a frontend/mobile take-home, so I chose to go all-in on Firebase Auth + Cloud Firestore.
The focus is on app architecture, UX, and state management rather than building a custom backend. 
All Firebase data access is still funneled through clean architecture and only resides in data layer.
Backend could be swapped later without changing other layers.

## AI-assisted workflow and per-feature docs

- Each feature/task is documented in the `documentations/` folder (separate from code) with:
    - `brief.md` → manual brief containing:
        - Context
        - Scope
        - Requirements
        - Clues
        - Keep in mind
    - `plan.md` → AI-assisted implementation plan
      (generated with Claude / other tools and then curated).

- Reasons for this structure:
    - **Context management**
      Each feature carries its own compact context, removing the need
      to reload the entire codebase into an AI tool or human memory.
    - **Token and time efficiency**
      When resuming work on a feature, only these two files need to be
      reviewed instead of all source files.
    - **Documentation for humans and AI**
      The brief captures intent and constraints; the plan captures the
      approach. Both help reviewers and AI tools stay aligned with the
      intended design.
    - **Separation of concerns**
      Documentation lives in `documentations/` while production code
      stays clean in `lib/`. This makes AI involvement explicit and
      reviewable without cluttering the codebase.

## Maestro Test Structure

The Maestro tests are organized following the entry point + runFlow pattern for better modularity and maintainability.

```
maestro/
├── all-tests.yaml                   # Entry point; runs platform suites
├── common/                          # Reusable flows shared between platforms
│   ├── auth-setup.yaml             # Authentication setup flow
│   └── setup-home.yaml             # Home screen setup flow
├── mobile/
│   ├── all-tests-mobile.yaml       # Mobile orchestrator; runs all mobile flows
│   └── flows/                      # Mobile-specific test flows
│       ├── auth-flow-mobile.yaml   # Mobile authentication tests
│       └── home-flow-mobile.yaml   # Mobile home screen tests
└── web/
    ├── all-tests-web.yaml          # Web orchestrator; runs all web flows
    └── flows/                      # Web-specific test flows
        ├── auth-flow-web.yaml      # Web authentication tests
        └── home-flow-web.yaml      # Web home screen tests
```

### Running Maestro Tests

```bash
maestro test maestro/all-tests.yaml
```

```bash
maestro test maestro/mobile/all-tests-mobile.yaml
```

```bash
maestro test maestro/web/all-tests-web.yaml
```

## Unit test
- Only test critical entity : rent entity
- Only test critical repo : auth repository

## Widget test
- Only test critical widget : authForm

## What will do if given more time?
- Complete all unit tests and widget tests (90%+ coverage)
- Implement plans on subscribe (still only shows snackbar)
- Implement promotions on click (still only shows snackbar)
