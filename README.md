Flutter mobile application targeting mobile and web, with platform-specific widgets split for clarity.

## Tech Stack

- Flutter 3.x
- Dart SDK ^3.9.2
- State management: Riverpod
- Primary datasource : Firebase Auth and Firestore

## Why Riverpod?

- Modern, compile-safe state management that pairs cleanly with `go_router`; GetX brings its own router, which conflicts with that approach.
- Less boilerplate and ceremony than Bloc while staying testable and explicit.
- Keeps dependency injection light and composable as features grow.

## Why Firebase Auth and Firestore?

This is a frontend/mobile take-home, so I chose to go all-in on Firebase Auth + Cloud Firestore.
The focus is on app architecture, UX, and state management rather than building a custom backend. 
All Firebase data access is still funneled through clean architecture and only resides in data layer.
Backend could be swapped later without changing other layers.

## AI-assisted workflow and per-feature docs

- Each feature/task is documented in the `documentations/` folder (separate from code) with:
    - `brief.md` → manual brief containing:
        - Context
        - Scope
        - Requirements
        - Clues
        - Keep in mind
    - `plan.md` → AI-assisted implementation plan
      (generated with Claude / other tools and then curated).

- Reasons for this structure:
    - **Context management**
      Each feature carries its own compact context, removing the need
      to reload the entire codebase into an AI tool or human memory.
    - **Token and time efficiency**
      When resuming work on a feature, only these two files need to be
      reviewed instead of all source files.
    - **Documentation for humans and AI**
      The brief captures intent and constraints; the plan captures the
      approach. Both help reviewers and AI tools stay aligned with the
      intended design.
    - **Separation of concerns**
      Documentation lives in `documentations/` while production code
      stays clean in `lib/`. This makes AI involvement explicit and
      reviewable without cluttering the codebase.

## Commands

- `flutter run` — Run app
- `flutter test` — Run tests
- `flutter analyze` — Lint check
- `flutter build apk` — Build Android
- `flutter build ios` — Build iOS

## Notes

- Widgets under `features/*/presentation/widgets` are split into `mobile`, `web`, and `shared` folders; import the appropriate one in screens based on platform needs.
