# Auth UI Slicing Brief

## Context
- Create widgets / UI for login feature
- Add appropriate widget for web and mobile (separate file)

## Scope
- UI only (do not create a logic for now)
- User will manually wire this to the main.dart, we will create the routing with go_router later
- just use name, email password, no need to create sign up with other methods for now

## Requirements
- created a screen (in auth folder) login_screen.dart
- this referencing to the login_screen_web.dart and login_screen_mobile.dart
- create login_web_screen.dart and login_screen_mobile.dart
- use the root/assets/images/login.png for the image in 

## Clues
- you could see for references in root/image-ref for both mobile and web screen
- for mobile, the login image is potrait and for web the login image is landscape

## Keep in Mind
- make the web screen still responsive
